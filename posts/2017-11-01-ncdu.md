title: Ncdu

Ncdu is my new favorite disk usage analyzer.

I've tried many different graphical visualizers.

Often I wind up using plain old `du`, perhaps because I don't
want to deal with a GUI, or I am logged in remotely, or I don't know what's
installed or where to find it in a given graphical launcher.

I tried `k4dirstat` today, and it was alright, but I just discovered `ncdu`.

The keybindings are natural--I didn't need to look at the manpage.  Arrows to
move around, d to delete, and it auto-updates the stats.  You can turn off the
safety prompts within the current session, if you start going crazy, and
they'll be back in place the next time, which is fine with me.

This is pretty much exactly the way I would have written it, except maybe
I would have turned on exclusion of external filesystems by default.

No plethora of dependencies and gnome/kde entanglement.

It's a small (68KB) binary that only needs ncurses.

Also, while reading about treemaps, I discovered
[The Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/)
which is a nice way to learn about industry in a given area for example.
