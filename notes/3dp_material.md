# 3d printer FDM materials (filaments)

(for FDM--fused deposition modeling, aka FFF--fused filament fabrication)

## Diameter

* 1.75mm and 3mm typically same cost per kg from mfg
* 1.75mm is actually a bit superior (heats faster, etc)
* 3mm requires more gearing (more torque) to feed
* but 3mm can be better for soft materials

## Material

* PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) aka PVOH, PVAL
  * $40 for 500g (relatively expensive)
  * biodegradable, non-toxic
  * can be dissolved if necessary (for support structures) in water
  * lower printing temperature--better support material for PLA
  * other applications: detergent tabs
  * good adhesion to PLA, CPE, and Nylon
  * lower moisture sensitivity during printing
  * extruder temperature 180-200
  * bed temperature 50
* PLA (polylactic acid)
  * $14 to $18 for 1kg
  * sets quickly
  * corn or potato starch
  * biodegradable, better for environment than ABS
  * recycling code 7; may cause problems in mixed recycle streams
  * most common, easy to paint, glue, etc, can acetone weld
  * careful when using hot glue or hot drill bits
  * extruder temperature 160-220
  * bed temperature ambient-60
* PolyMAX (very strong PLA)
  * $45 for 750g
  * impact strength 9x of PLA, 1.2x of ABS
  * about as strong as ABS
  * less brittle than PLA--filament doesn't snap, gradual vs sudden failure
  * still subject to melting at low temperatures like PLA
* ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)
  * $15 to $25 for 1kg
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 9; typically not allowed in mixed recycle streams
  * can be sanded, polished
  * tends to warp, best w/ heated chamber, but can acetone weld & vapor smooth
  * extruder temperature 215-250
  * bed temperature 90-103
* ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate)
  * better UV and weather resistance than ABS--use for outdoors
  * extruder temperature 240-260
  * bed temperature 80-100
* PET/PETG/PETT
  * about $20 for 1kg
  * same material as disposable plastic water bottles
  * more flexible than PLA or ABS
  * extruder temperature 235-260
  * bed temperature required
* TPU
  * about $25 for 800g
  * flexible
  * good for phone cases
* HIPS (high impact polystyrene)
  * $20 for 1kg
  * can be dissolved if necessary (supports structures) via Limonene
  * food safe, non-toxic and recyclable
  * as strong and hard as ABS
  * easily machined, sanded, glued, and painted
* PC (polycarbonate)
  * $40 for 750g (Polymaker PC-Max)
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 7
  * very strong and tough plastic, better than ABS
  * can be sanded
  * durable up to 110C
  * extruder temperature 280-305
  * bed temperature 85-95
* HDPE (high density polyethylene)
  * more difficult to work with than ABS or PLA
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 2
  * resists most solvents and glues
  * extruder temperature 225-230
  * bed temperature ambient
* Nylon (polyamide)
  * good for hinges
  * beware, very moisture sensitive
  * extruder temperature 240-270
  * bed temperature 60-80
* NylonX (polyamide with chopped carbon fiber)
  * more stable and rigid than nylon
  * extruder temperature 250-270
  * bed temperature 50-70
* Taulman3d Alloy 910
* Markforged carbon fiber reinforced nylon filament
  * 20x stiffer than ABS
  * 5x stronger than ABS
  * stronger than aluminum by weight
  * high thermal conductivity
  * currently proprietary Markforged printers (also onyx)
* LAYBRICK
  * looks a bit like stone
  * stiff, brittle
  * higher extruder temperature for more sand-stone like grainy/pitted look
* Wood filaments (LAYWOOD, woodfill, timberfill, corkfill)
  * PLA base with additives
  * looks and feels like wood
  * watch out for too high of temperature--wood additives will burn
  * remove filament from extruder immediately after printing
* Conductive filament
  * PLA base
  * low voltage and low current only
* LayCeramic
  * like normal clay, you fire and glaze the product
  * need full metal hotend, 3mm, and filament warmer... and a kiln of course
* Carbon Fiber Reinforced PLA (ProtoPasta)
  * good for drone bodies, propellers, and RC car frames
  * need hardened steel nozzle
* BrassFill, BronzeFill, CopperFill, SteelFill (metal infused filaments)
  * PLA base
  * heavier than regular PLA
  * see also Magnetic Iron PLA
* Lay-Felt, Gel-Lay, Lay-Foam
  * internal PLA disolves to leave porous spongy material
* BendLay
  * nearly transparent
  * food safe
* MoldLay
  * designed for mold making, can melt or vaporize out of the way
* reprap cmptbl syringe and/or paste extruder--chocolate, icing, clay, etc.
  * heated barracuda extruder
  * unheated universal paste extruder
