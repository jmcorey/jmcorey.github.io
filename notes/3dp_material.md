# 3d printer FDM materials (filaments)

(for FDM--fused deposition modeling, aka FFF--fused filament fabrication)

## Diameter

* 1.75mm and 3mm typically same cost per kg from mfg
* 1.75mm is actually a bit superior (heats faster, etc)
* 3mm requires more gearing (more torque) to feed
* but 3mm can be better for soft materials

## Material

See https://hackaday.com/2016/02/01/3d-printing-fumes-new-science/

* PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) aka PVOH, PVAL
  * biodegradable, non-toxic
  * can be dissolved if necessary (for support structures) in water
  * lower printing temperature--better support material for PLA
  * other applications: detergent tabs
  * good adhesion to PLA, CPE, and Nylon
  * lower moisture sensitivity during printing
  * extruder temperature 180-200
  * bed temperature 50
* PLA (polylactic acid)
  * sets quickly
  * corn or potato starch
  * biodegradable, better for environment than ABS
  * recycling code 7; may cause problems in mixed recycle streams
  * most common, easy to paint, glue, etc, can acetone weld
  * careful when using hot glue or hot drill bits
  * extruder temperature 160-220
  * bed temperature ambient-60
* PolyMAX (very strong PLA)
* ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 9; typically not allowed in mixed recycle streams
  * can be sanded, polished
  * tends to warp, best w/ heated chamber, but can acetone weld & vapor smooth
  * extruder temperature 215-250
  * bed temperature 90-103
* PETG
  * same material as disposable plastic water bottles
  * more flexible than PLA or ABS
  * extruder temperature 235-260
  * bed temperature required
* PET more brittle than PETG, higher temperature (260 vs 230)
* TPU: flexible, good for phone cases
* HIPS (high impact polystyrene)
  * can be dissolved if necessary (supports structures) via Limonene
  * food safe, non-toxic and recyclable
  * as strong and hard as ABS
  * easily machined, sanded, glued, and painted
* PC (polycarbonate)
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 7
  * very strong and tough plastic
  * extruder temperature 280-305
  * bed temperature 85-95
* HDPE (high density polyethylene)
  * non-biodegradable
  * recycling code 2
  * resists most solvents and glues
  * extruder temperature 225-230
  * bed temperature ambient
* Nylon
* Taulman3d Alloy 910

* Markforged carbon fiber reinforced nylon filament
  * 20x stiffer than ABS
  * 5x stronger than ABS
  * stronger than aluminum by weight
  * high thermal conductivity
  * currently proprietary Markforged printers (also onyx)
* copper and bronze infused filaments
* sawdust infused filaments
* reprap cmptbl syringe and/or paste extruder--chocolate, icing, clay, etc.
  * heated barracuda extruder
  * unheated universal paste extruder
