# 3d printers

## Points of comparison

### Basic info

* cartesian or delta
  * delta can move faster--no need to move flat bed
  * delta tends to expand upwards--taller parts
  * delta better for round-ish prism shapes
  * cartesian is better for cube-ish shapes (rectangular base)
  * cartesian may have slightly better straight lines
* max print size

### Platform

* heated? max temperature?
* removable cover?
  * e.g. prusa replaceable textured spring steel plate?
* subject to warp?

### Nozzle and extruder assembly

* how smoothly is filament fed?
* what happens when filament breaks or runs out?
* extruder feed: geared? 
* boden feed or direct feed: boden not so good for flexible filaments
* nozzle with multiple feeds?  multiple nozzles?
* all metal tubing feeding hot end, not teflon, for high temp materials
* support multi-color?  multi-material?  both at same time?
* part cooler fan? how many, how good?
* max temperature?
* protection from overheating?
* alternate nozzles readily available?
* alternate extruder assemblies (e.g. multi-material) available?

### General mechanics and quality

* how sturdy is frame
* how tight are tolerances on guide beams
* auto-levelling?
* nozzle height probe: inductive? capacitive (avoid)? optical?
* 12v vs 24v power supply and parts (24 is better, but... 12v batteries?)
* quality of benchmark prints
* don't worry about layer height, it's deceptive
* any proprietary impediments to hacking on the hardware?

### Misc features

* noise level
* number of USB ports
* memory slot type (SD card or USB stick? or none?)
* wifi support? octoprint?
* LCD display and interaction that doesn't suck? touchscreen...
* ease of assembly (are there clear directions?)
* color-mixing hot end?
* support "ironing" top layer?
* "velocity painting"?

### Usability, compatibility, openness

* number of suppliers of filament... use whatever desired? price...
  * hopefully not a proprietary hitch where have to buy filament from them
* is both the hardware and software open?  in deed as well as word--compliance
* are the materials open and plainly communicated or hidden and proprietary?
* is it explicitly listed as working with linux?
  * all the downloadable items?
* compatible with which printer controller (e.g. franklin, printrun)
* is it listed in Cura supported printer list
  * https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/tree/master/resources/definitions
  * see also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura_(software))
* vendor website--coded well? which webserver? netcraft uptime?
  * are they buffoons in general?
* have a look at their github repo
  * insights / liveness
  * good commit and coding practices
  * long outstanding issues and/or pull requests?
  * random spot checks
* reputation re user support, and accessibility/friendliness of community
  * can see forums?  random spot checks
* "youtube test" -- how many youtube videos for that specific printer
* they and their printer have been around a while and are shipping
* google trends
