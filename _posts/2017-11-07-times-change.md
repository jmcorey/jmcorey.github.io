title: Times Change: Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know, by Year
---

I ran across a cool presentation of the "Numbers Every Programmer Should Know"
regarding how much time it takes to do disk/memory/network I/O.

It shows a [visualization](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html) of the stats, and changes as you move the year
slider.
