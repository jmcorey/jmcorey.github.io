title: ncdu is much more comfortable than du
---

I've tried many different graphical visualizers for hunting down disk usage.

Seems like I most often find myself using plain old `du`, often because I don't
want to deal with a GUI, or I am logged in remotely, or I don't know what's
installed or where to find it in a given graphical launcher.

I tried `k4dirstat` today, and it was alright, but I also discovered...

```
ncdu
```

Run it like that, and it will explore the current directory.  Or you can
point it at a particular directory.  The keybindings just work--I didn't
need to look at the manpage.  Arrows to move around, d to delete, and
it auto-updates the stats.  You can turn off the safety prompts within the
current session, if you start going crazy, and they'll be back in place
the next time, which is just fine with me.

This is pretty much exactly the way I would have written it, except maybe
I would have made exclusion of external filesystems on by default.

No plethora of dependencies and gnome/kde entanglement.

It's a 68K binary that only needs ncurses.

Although, while reading about treemaps, I discovered
[The Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/)
which is a nice way to learn about the industry in a given area for example.
