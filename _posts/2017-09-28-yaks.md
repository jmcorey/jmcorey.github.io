title: What They Say About Yak Shaving
---

"Yak Shaving" is one of those pointlessly cryptic phrases that was briefly
hip among some Americans though not so much any more.

I never really knew precisely the meaning, and apparently if I spent a lot of
time watching Ren & Stimpy, I still wouldn't know.  But apparently a consistent
meaning did eventually gel.  [Joi Ito's writeup](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2005/03/05/yak-shaving.html) is a nice treatment.  It quotes this explanation--not a great one, but it suffices:

> You start out deciding to tidy your room and you realize that in order to do that you'll need some more trash bags, so you need to go to the shops, which will involve you getting out the car, but the car needs gas, so you'll need to go to the gas station first, which means you should probably find your gas discount card, which involves finding your keys, which are in the room somewhere...

Taking it to its conclusion in a pithy way, "What if it's Yaks all the way
down" Joi has a thoughtful defense against the implicit condemnation of all
such activity, which seems less commonly considered.  He summarizes thus:

> ... it is through this fiddling that I sometimes find myself in a new place, sometimes slightly before the rest of the pack. If it weren't for this fiddling, I'd be spending my life solving boring problems for boring bosses
