title: "Yak Shaving"?

It's one of those phrases.  The widespread comprehension failure is rivalled
by the stupidity of the origins.

[Joi Ito's writeup](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2005/03/05/yak-shaving.html) is a nice treatment.  He covers the standard idea:

> You start out deciding to tidy your room and you realize that in order to do that you'll need some more trash bags, so you need to go to the shops, which will involve you getting out the car, but the car needs gas, so you'll need to go to the gas station first, which means you should probably find your gas discount card, which involves finding your keys, which are in the room somewhere...

But he offers a counterpoint to the usual implicit condemnation:

> ... it is through this fiddling that I sometimes find myself in a new place, sometimes slightly before the rest of the pack. If it weren't for this fiddling, I'd be spending my life solving boring problems for boring bosses.
